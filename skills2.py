    This function should take a single string and return a dictionary
    that has all of the distinct words as keys, and the number of times
    that word appears in the string.


    For example:

        >>> print_dict(count_unique("each word appears once"))
        {'appears': 1, 'each': 1, 'once': 1, 'word': 1}
  
    Words that appear more than once should be counted each time:

    It's fine to consider punctuation part of a word (e.g., a comma
    at the end of a word can be counted as part of that word) and
    to consider differently-capitalized words as different:
