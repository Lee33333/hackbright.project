    33.3 percent of medical schools dedicate zero hours of their curriculum to LGBT health. On average, medical schools dedicate five hours to LGBT health education, and the quality of this education is widely variable.
Findings from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900137">“Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-related content in undergraduate medical education” JAMA (2011)</a><br>
56 percent of LGBT people faced refusal of care or physical or verbal abuse by health care professionals when seeking health care. These experiences were increased to 70 percent in the transgender population. In fact, there was a marked degree of anticipation among LGBT patients that they would face discrimination.
